#
# Equivalence table between OGMP masterfile qualifiers and their textual
# description.
#
# Last modified: 19Jul2006 gb; explanations added.
# The format is as follow:
#
# qualifier class[|class[|class...]]    textual description
#
# The first column contains a qualifier. The second column contains
# one or many class names, separated by "|" (without any space). If
# the qualifier belong to the specific class "note", then after the class
# names should follow a textual description in which blank spaces
# are significant. If the two characters "%s" are found in the description,
# they are replaced by the value assigned to the qualifier; for example,
# if the masterfile contains "/coffees=4" and the textual description for
# "coffees" is "The author drank %s coffees that day", then a program like
# mf2sd would put into the note field "The author drank 4 coffees that day".
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
